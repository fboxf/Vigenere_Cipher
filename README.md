## Brief
This project allowed me to learn about creating a secret key called the Vigenere cipher. It is a development on the well-known Caesar cipher.Using the Caesar cipher each letter is shifted (encrypted) according to:

f (p) = (p + x)mod26

x is the amount of shifting through the alphabet to encode the original text (the plaintext) into a hidden message (the ciphertext). For example if i x = 1 then

> a = b,
> b = c,
> ...,
> z=a

Decryption occurs through:

f(to the power of -1)(p) = (p − k) mod 26

This may have been good on the battlefield, or as a child sharing the location of your toy cars, but it is fairly (very?!) easy to break.

The Vigenere cipher was created to make this a bit more difficult by creating a two-dimensional matrix of letters
